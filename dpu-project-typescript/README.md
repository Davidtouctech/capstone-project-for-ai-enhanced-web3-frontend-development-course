# MY EXPERIENCE

This section was both fascinating and interesting. 

## What I Learnt
I learnt how to include TypeScript into my project, how to automate it incase of any changes made and how to convert my vanilla JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Challenges and How I Overcame them

I didn't experience any challenge here because the explanations from the tutor was quite clear. However I had to watch the video more than once to grasp everything that was said
